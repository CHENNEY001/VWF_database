# VWF_database
This is a VWD patient information management system based on Apache+Php+MySQL

Von Willebrand Disease, VWD, is the most common inherited bleeding disorder in humans, caused by the deficiency and abnormal function of Von Willebrand Factor, VWF. 
This project initially constructed a VWF mutation database VWFDB (Von Willebrand Factor Database) with comprehensive functions, collected and stored the clinical detection data and VWF mutation information data of VWD patients, so as to facilitate Ruijin Hospital and nationwide.
The VWF mutation data included in this database includes the complete clinical information of more than 220 VWD patients from the Thrombosis and Hemostasis Research Group of Ruijin Hospital, as well as the gene mutation data and phenotypes of the VWD patient information data (more than 1,000 cases) in the Human Gene Mutation Database (mmc).
The functions provided by the VWF mutation database for different types of users (medical staff, ordinary users) include data display, data entry, data editing and deletion, keyword search, mutation data visual browsing, data download, etc. 
The database is of great significance for the statistical research and preventive diagnosis of VWD."
